This project is a SQL data exploratory analysis on two Covid-19 datasets, which include Covid-19 deaths and Covid-19 vaccinations. The Covid-19 deaths dataset was
compressed due to it being large and not being able to upload, however this file contains information about covid-19 confirmed deaths worldwide. The Covid vaccinations dataset 
contains information about confirmed vaccinations worldwide. 

The two datasets were downloaded from the following sites:
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations
